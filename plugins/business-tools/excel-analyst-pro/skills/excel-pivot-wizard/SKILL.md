## Common Analysis Patterns

### Pattern 1: Single Dimension Summary
**Request:** "Show total sales by region"

**Output:**
```
| Region    | Total Sales |
|-----------|-------------|
| Northeast | $1,250,000  |
| Southeast | $980,000    |
| Midwest   | $1,100,000  |
| West      | $1,450,000  |
| Total     | $4,780,000  |
```

### Pattern 2: Cross-Tabulation
**Request:** "Sales by region and product category"

**Output:**
```
| Region    | Electronics | Clothing | Home Goods | Total     |
|-----------|-------------|----------|------------|-----------|
| Northeast | $400K       | $500K    | $350K      | $1,250K   |
| Southeast | $300K       | $380K    | $300K      | $980K     |
| Midwest   | $450K       | $350K    | $300K      | $1,100K   |
| West      | $550K       | $500K    | $400K      | $1,450K   |
| Total     | $1,700K     | $1,730K  | $1,350K    | $4,780K   |
```

### Pattern 3: Time-Based Trending
**Request:** "Monthly revenue trend for 2024"

**Output:**
```
Line chart showing:
- X-axis: Jan, Feb, Mar, ..., Dec
- Y-axis: Revenue
- Line: Monthly revenue with data labels
```

### Pattern 4: Top N Analysis
**Request:** "Top 10 products by revenue"

**Output:**
```
| Rank | Product       | Revenue   | % of Total |
|------|---------------|-----------|------------|
| 1    | Product A     | $450,000  | 9.4%       |
| 2    | Product B     | $380,000  | 7.9%       |
| 3    | Product C     | $350,000  | 7.3%       |
| ...  | ...           | ...       | ...        |
| 10   | Product J     | $180,000  | 3.8%       |
|      | Top 10 Total  | $2,850,000| 59.6%      |
|      | All Others    | $1,930,000| 40.4%      |
|      | Grand Total   | $4,780,000| 100.0%     |
```

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### 1. Understand the Data

Ask clarifying questions if needed:
- What does each column represent?
- What grain is the data? (transaction-level, daily summary, etc.)
- What fields should be aggregated vs grouped?

### 2. Interpret the Request

Parse natural language into pivot table structure:

**"Show sales by region and month"** â†’
```
Rows: Region
Columns: Month
Values: Sum of Sales
```

**"Average order value by customer segment"** â†’
```
Rows: Customer Segment
Values: Average of Order Value
```

**"Count of orders by product category and sales rep"** â†’
```
Rows: Product Category
Columns: Sales Rep
Values: Count of Orders
```

### 3. Build the Pivot Table

Use Excel MCP server to:
1. Create pivot table on new sheet
2. Set row fields
3. Set column fields (if cross-tab)
4. Set value fields with aggregation function
5. Add filters/slicers if requested
6. Apply formatting (currency, thousands separator, etc.)

### 4. Add Enhancements

**Conditional Formatting:**
```
- Top 10% values: Dark green
- Bottom 10% values: Dark red
- Color scale for heatmap effect
```

**Calculated Fields:**
```
- Profit Margin % = (Revenue - Cost) / Revenue
- Growth % = (This Year - Last Year) / Last Year
- % of Total = Value / Grand Total
```

**Sorting:**
```
- Largest to smallest by default
- Or chronological for dates
```

### 5. Create Visualization

If visualization is requested or would be helpful:

**For Comparisons:** Column chart
**For Trends:** Line chart
**For Composition:** Pie/donut chart
**For Correlations:** Scatter plot
**For Multiple Metrics:** Combo chart (column + line)

## Example Interactions

### Example 1: Sales Analysis

**User:** "Analyze sales by region and product category"

**Skill Response:**
```
I'll create a pivot table to analyze sales by region and product category.

Looking at your data, I see:
- 5,234 transaction rows
- Date range: Jan 1 - Oct 27, 2025
- 4 regions, 12 product categories

Creating pivot table...

- Pareto chart: Cumulative % of revenue

ðŸ’¡ Strategic Implications:
1. Focus inventory on Top 20 products (likely 80% of revenue)
2. Bundle high-volume + high-margin items
3. Wireless Buds: Explore upsell to Pro Buds (higher margin?)
```

## Advanced Features

### Calculated Fields

**Request:** "Show profit margin by product category"

**Response:**
```
I'll add a calculated field for profit margin.

Assuming you have Cost and Revenue columns, I'll calculate:
Profit Margin % = (Revenue - Cost) / Revenue Ã— 100%

| Category    | Revenue | Cost    | Profit  | Margin % |
|-------------|---------|---------|---------|----------|
| Electronics | $1,700K | $1,020K | $680K   | 40.0%    |
| Clothing    | $1,730K | $1,125K | $605K   | 35.0%    |
| Home Goods  | $1,350K | $945K   | $405K   | 30.0%    |
| Total       | $4,780K | $3,090K | $1,690K | 35.4%    |

Electronics has the highest margin (40%) despite not being the highest revenue category.
```

### Slicers & Filters

**Request:** "Add filters for date range and region"

**Response:**
```
I've added slicers for:
1. Date Range (select quarters or specific months)
2. Region (select one or multiple regions)
3. Product Category (filter to specific categories)

These slicers are linked to the pivot table - any selection will update the data automatically.

Try clicking Q3 in the date slicer to see summer performance!
```

### Multiple Aggregations

**Request:** "Show sum and average of sales by region"

**Response:**
```
| Region    | Total Sales | Avg Sale | Order Count |
|-----------|-------------|----------|-------------|
| Northeast | $1,250,000  | $625     | 2,000       |
| Southeast | $980,000    | $490     | 2,000       |
| Midwest   | $1,100,000  | $524     | 2,100       |
| West      | $1,450,000  | $690     | 2,100       |

Interesting: Southeast has lowest average sale despite same order count as Northeast.
This suggests smaller basket sizes in Southeast - worth investigating!
```

## Formatting Best Practices

The Skill applies professional formatting:

### Numbers
```
Revenue: $1,250,000 or $1.25M (use M for millions)
Counts: 2,000 (thousands separator)
Percentages: 35.0% (1 decimal)
```

### Conditional Formatting
```
Top performers: Green highlight
Bottom performers: Red highlight
Heatmap: Color gradient from red (low) to green (high)
```

### Layout
```
- Bold headers
- Freeze top row and left column
- Subtotals and grand totals
- Alternating row colors for readability
```
